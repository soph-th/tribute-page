  <h3>Reasons Snails Deserve Love</h3> 

    <ol id="tribute-info">

    <li>They can be so tiny.
    <li>They can be massive.
    <li>They can probably travel up to 100kmh but choose not to.
    <li>Gravity means nothing to them.
    <li>All words mean nothing to them. They don't have ears.
    <li>They have little boppy eyes on stalks.
    <li><a target="_blank"href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_snail">Mersnails exist</a>.
    <li>They can feel vibrations, especially good ones.
    <li>They inspired <a target="_blank"href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eab_beh07HU">this hit Beach Boys song</a>.
    <li>They leave a trail of destruction and/or slime.
    <li>They have adorable kitten faces.
    <li>They feast on the flesh of cuttlefish, much like their ancestors feasted on the flesh of the kraken.
